### Step 2: Navigate to the Code Directory and Start Training

1. **Navigate to the Code Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Change to the directory containing the `main.py` file. For example:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/LT-PINN/DT/code
     ```

2. **Run the Training Script**:
   - Execute the `main.py` script to start training:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
